# spring-boot-cloud-streams-kafka-streams-json-example

This is a Spring Boot and Spring Cloud example of how to read in JSON from a Kakfa topic and, via Kafka Streams, create a single json doc from subsequent JSON documents.  

This is a redo of my [kafka-streams-spring-boot-json-example](https://github.com/mknutty/kafka-streams-spring-boot-json-example). See that repo for more details on the why and how.
